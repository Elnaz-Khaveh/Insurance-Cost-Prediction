# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This is the project “Insurance Cost Prediction” which is done to predict the insurance cost, from the “Insurance” dataset. 
The prediction was done by training Linear Models (LM) and Random Forest (RF) to check which one performs better. 
The whole project was done in R. To compare these 2 models, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R Squared were used. 
The results indicate that Random Forest outperforms the other model.
